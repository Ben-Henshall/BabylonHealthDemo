##Installation

This project uses Carthage to install dependencies. Rather than using the traditional "Carthage update" method, it uses the lightweight method of --no-build.

To update the dependencies, use:
`carthage update --use-submodules --no-build`

The dependencies are built in the BabylonHealthDemo workspace. USE THIS WORKSPACE TO BUILD AND EXECUTE THE PROJECT.
